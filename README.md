## Short description

### What's the problem?

Communication and awareness is the hour of the need, people can use this bot and embed in their existing application if they want. In times of crisis like Covid-19 pandemic, communications systems are often overwhelmed with people trying to find basic information about testing, symptoms, community response, and other resources. When communication lines get clogged, people who need real help can't get through.

### How can technology help?

Whether via text, phone, websites, or communication apps, conversing with chatbots and other AI-enabled resources can play a critical role in helping communities quickly understand crucial information and free up customer service resources to focus on higher-level issues.

### The idea

It's imperative that communications systems shouldn't be affected in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable everyone to more easily get statictics/help available about the COVID-19. We will have a AI-Voice Enabled Chatbot that will help answer many queries revolving around COVID-19.
